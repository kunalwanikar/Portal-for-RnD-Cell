# Portal-for-RnD-Cell
This project is a portal for the Reseach and Development cell of the college which can be modified according to the college requirements.
It aims for centralizing the information of the R&D cell of the college and make it available to the authorities whenever needed.
This is done using login for every professor using the credentials provided by the R&D cell. Each professor can enter their details after the first login and later they can update their research work. This research paper will be available in the backend in an SQL Database. This data of complete college is available with the Dean R&D and the principal account. While HOD can access only the data of his/her department.
The main features of the portal are : 
1) Provides special access of data to different roles like Principal, Dean, HOD, Professor. 
2) Restriction for each role of what information they can access.
3) Creates a spreadsheet (which can be downloaded) and sort the data as instructed.
